PROJECT: Personal Activity Tracker (Web App)

TIME LIMIT
Maximum 3 days (approximately 12–16 focused hours)

STACK (MANDATORY)

JavaScript (ES6+)

React (functional components only)

No backend

No external state libraries

LocalStorage only

Minimal CSS (clarity over design)

CORE OBJECTIVE
Build a single-page React web app that allows a user to create activities, 
track daily completions, and view summaries over time. The goal is to train 
logic and state patterns that transfer directly to React Native.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT

User can add an activity

Name (required)

Category (optional)

User can delete an activity

Activities persist across reloads

Constraints:

Activity IDs must be generated in JavaScript

Do not use array index as keys

All inputs must be controlled components

DAILY TRACKING

User can mark an activity as completed for “today”

Completion must be date-specific

Prevent multiple completions for the same activity on the same date

Constraint:

Completion data must be stored in a structure that supports multiple 
dates (not a boolean flag)

SUMMARY VIEW

Display total number of activities

Display number completed today

Display completion streak per activity (consecutive days)

Constraint:

Streaks must be computed dynamically, not stored

PERSISTENCE

All app data must persist using localStorage

App must rehydrate state on initial load

Constraint:

No direct localStorage calls inside JSX

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

STATE DESIGN

Decide what state is global vs local

Decide where side effects live

Choose a data shape that allows future expansion

You must be able to justify these decisions verbally

REQUIRED REACT CONCEPTS

useState

useEffect

Props drilling (no context)

Conditional rendering

List rendering with keys

Controlled inputs

DATA MODEL (EXAMPLE ONLY)
activities =

id (string)

name (string)

category (string or null)

completions (array of date strings, e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)

UI REQUIREMENTS

At least 2 distinct views

Main tracker view

Summary view

View switching must be state-based (no routing)

Clear separation of components

REQUIRED COMPONENTS

App

ActivityForm

ActivityList

ActivityItem

SummaryView

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN

Following tutorials during implementation

Copy-pasting app templates

External UI libraries

Redux, Zustand, Context

Date libraries (use native Date only)

OPTIONAL STRETCH GOALS (ONLY IF TIME REMAINS)

Filter activities by category

Edit activity names

Visual completion indicators

Undo delete

DELIVERABLES BY END OF DAY 3

Fully working application

Clean component separation

Readable, intentional state logic

Commit history (local is sufficient)

WHY THIS PROJECT TRANSFERS TO REACT NATIVE

Trains state modeling used in mobile apps

Enforces side-effect discipline

Builds persistence logic independent of platform

Reinforces component composition

UI logic is reusable; only components change

SELF-EVALUATION CHECKLIST
You are not finished unless you can answer:

Why is state shaped this way?

What breaks if the app scales?

Where would async APIs fit?

Which components would become screens in React Native?
